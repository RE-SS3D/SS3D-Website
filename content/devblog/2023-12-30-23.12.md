# Q4 Recap

This quarter has been exceptionally productive for us. A LARGE percentage of that productivity can be creditted to **Nath**, who has rightfully earn the "Employee of the Month" status again (read through the blog and you'll see why). And of course, none of the productivity would be possible without our loyal and selfless reviewers; the big ones being **Nath**, **IAmTeapot**, & **John**.

This quarter also marked the moment in time which we finally converted our website to something easier to maintain for Windows users. Thanks to **Alainx277**, [the website](https://github.com/RE-SS3D/SS3D-website) is now based on Zola instead of Jekyll/Ruby!

# Basic Health Expansion

You may remember from our [previous blog](https://ss3d.space/devblog/23-09/) that **Nath** implemented a rudimentary health system. Well, this quarter he expanded on the system by adding oxygen damage and the basic components for its functionality.

**Nath** added 2 organs, lungs and heart. The lungs breathe in oxygen from the environment (atmos not implemented currently), the oxygen is then distributed throughout the bodyparts which themselves can now contain substances within (such as oxygen/blood). Oxygen damage is inflicted when this process is interupted and the character is not recieving enough of it.

Not directly related to health, but, **Nath** also improved the modularity of the human prefab and body parts making it easier and more effecient to make changes to them.

# Simple Crafting

**Nath** started building the crafting system this quarter. So far he has implemented basic item replacement crafting, based on our [simple crafting design](https://ss3d.gitbook.io/design/actions/crafting/makeshift-simple-crafting).

The system uses recipes. A recipe consists of an interaction (like using a tool), a target (where to apply the interaction), and a list of items (including quantity) required. A crafting interaction only works when all 3 conditions are met appropriately.

Required items are currently only considered available for crafting when they are within a close proximity to the player character (this will be expanded to the character's inventory in the future). Required items are consumed during the crafting interaction, tools are not.

# Basic Electricity

We now have the foundation of the electricity system, thanks to **Nath**! Currently it includes station batteries (SMES), electrical cables, an infinite energy generator, and lights which will turn on/off depending on the power availability.

The SMES can be turned on/off, it can intake power, store it, and output it. All of these are represented by lights on the machine (currently the world lighting is not set up so the lights on the machine are difficult to see). SMES can be stacked together on a circuit.

Electrical cables are taking the place of our wires for now, due to our wires require a more complex connection script. Cables connect electrical devices, creating a circuit.

The infinite energy generator is also a placeholder for something more complex later on of course, but for now it serves the purpose of being the *producer* of electricity.

Lights are *consumers* of electricity. If the available electricity for the light dips below its required threshold, the light siezes activity. If there are more electricty consumption by lights than there is electricity being provided by producers on a circuit, than the lights will begin to blink on/off as the electricity becomes available to it. This applies to other electricity consumers (most machines) as well.

# More Tests

Initially started by **Ryan** but then continued by **Nath**, we now have play-mode tests implemented. Play-mode tests test game systems during runtime conditions. Indiviudal tests need to be writted for each thing we plan to test, but the system functions. The system can reliably reproduce a specific fault under a variety of conditions, such as different server/host/client arrangements. This allows contributors attempting to resolve those faults to more clearly understand the problem.

Edit-mode tests have now been restructured also, so now they are more clear in what they are testing.

# Reworked Asset Data Management

**John** reworked the asset data system to not rely on enums anymore but instead a DatabaseAsset which uses databases of different assets to help organize and reference them. The new system is more effecient, easier to use, and should be more long-term reliable.

# Tilemap Improvements

Several improvements to the tilemap system were made recently. First, **Nath** refactored the tilemap menu script due to the size and rate of which it was growing. He separated the script into 5 smaller scripts based on its components. This change makes it easier to manage and document the different tilemap components.

Next, **Nath** added the ability for multiple tile-objects to exist on a individual tilemap layer. Currently he implemented this for wallmounts. Wallmounts are objects mounted to walls (signs, fire alarms, lights, etc..). Now, the wallmount layers can have up to four objects attached, one for each cardinal direction, given that there is no wall connection in that direction.

**Nath** also implemented an optional limit for tile-object rotation based on object. By default tile-objects can be rotated to any of the 4 cardinal directions, but for some symetrical objects, like walls, there is not need to rotate. There are other examples of this as well.

Additionally, **IAmTeapot** added functionality for faster tilemap (map) construction. Drag the object to make a line of tile-objects. Use Alt + Drag to make a square of tile-objects. These new functions also work in tandem with our old function of using Shift to replace tile-objects.

Finally, **Nath** added the ability to save, load, and name maps. He also added the ability to switch between maps during runtime. Switching maps pre-runtime can be easily added later.

# Connectable Improvements

**Nath** refactored the connectables scripts, breaking apart the single massive script into smaller, simpler, and easier to maintain scripts. In the process several small bugs were fixed as well.

**Nath**, the magician, also managed to write the connection script for our [directional connectables](https://ss3d.gitbook.io/design/environment/connectables/directional-adjacency-connections)! Directional connectables are a complex type of connectable that only connects in directions based on the objects' rotation. Most other types connect to any adjacent tile regardless of rotation.

# Return of Audio

**Nath** reimplemented the audio system originally added by **Eiko** a couple years ago. This includes interaction sounds, collision sounds, ambient sounds, & music players. He also added networking syncing for noises which was not implemented previously.

# Return of the Ragdoll

**IAmTeapot** re-implemented ragdoll. The ragdoll component switches between four stages; Walking, ragdoll, BonesReset, & StandingUp. During BonesReset bones interpolate from the latest ragdoll positions to the position first frame of animation. During StandingUp the ragdoll component plays a stand-up animation.

# Return of Examination

You may remember our detailed examine system from a [couple years ago](https://ss3d.space/devblog/21-06/), implemented by **Ryan**. Well **Ryan** returned (with help from **Nath**) to re-implement this feature now that we are past our project rework.

The system has also recieved a few improvements. The old implementation used a raycast to assign and store a color value. It would periodically take a snapshot of the screen using the color shader, wait for a callback to recieve the color under cursor and then would display the object's examination data. This caused a slight delay by a few frames for the data to appear. The new system allocates colors to selectables upon creation and has continuous selectable rendering, preventing any delay. The render itself has also recieved performance improvements.
