Small changes with a big impact.

# October Recap

Very few merged changes this month, but none were lacking in importance as they are all related to networking or core system performance.

## Details

- GREATLY improved the performance of the examine system.

**Ryan**
- Updated the Mirror version for the project, to v49.0.1.
- Fixed a bug where clients weren't reinitializing the map after it loaded.
- Fixed an issue preventing child objects from being found during reinitialization.

## Art

As per usual, this month's blog cover was contributed by **ProbablyNot**.
