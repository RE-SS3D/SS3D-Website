# October Recap

This month was a bit slow in development again, but we have had a fun time in the discord with this month's art contest (winners announced below)!

## Fixes

**Macoron**, a new contributor this month, separated the game logic from the UI views with individual prefabs which should help decrease future spaghetti code.

## Models

**Eiko** never seems to dissapoint with his 3D art! This month he contributed a boxing mat, boxing ring, throwing knives & stars, and a few adorable plushies!

<div class='horizontal-2' markdown='1'>

  {{ image(kind="split", src="assets/img/posts/20.10.01/Eiko_BoxingRing.png") }}
</div>

</div>

## UI

**Konstantin3001** is back with more UI graphics, specifically with a targetting doll.
