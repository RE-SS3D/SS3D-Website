Cheers to the new years, let hope this one is better than the last!

# December Recap

Apologies for the delay in gettting this month's blog post made, but we hope everyone had a great holiday season despite what we are all going through in this crazy world.

## Fixes

**Seteron** Retimed the move cycle to fix the symmetry of the run/walk animations. He also fixed the inverted SSRT when using OpenGL drivers.

**John** made countless small fixes to many of our models again this month, regarding topology, shading, style, and more.

## Details

**CosmicCoincidence** moved several more art assets into the game, most notably some botany-related furniture, items, and plants (and added a botany room to the station).

**Goao** also submitted a few things this month, including a keg, wire cutters, an action figure, a toy spaceship, and a full assortment of grenades!
